##Instructions
+ To import into Eclipse: (1) clone the repository, (2) File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace and then navigate to the location of the cloned repository and import it, (3) right-click the root folder and select Build Path > Configure Build Path > Add External JARs... and then navigate to the Java file on your computer and add it, (4) import JUnit by hovering over errors in any of the unit test files.
+ Locate the SimCityGui.java file in the simcity.gui package, and execute it as a Java Application in Eclipse by right-clicking the file and selecting Run As > Java Application.

###Scenarios
+ Currently one person ("Narwhal Prime") spawns in his own house...

###Issues/problems
+ Currently we only have one restaurant that has full job functionality. Over time we believe we can do the same for the other restaurants.

####Transportation
+ A* may cause agents to get caught in the awkward sidewalk dance of going back and forth without passing each other.
